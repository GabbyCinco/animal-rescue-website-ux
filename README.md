# Animal rescue website UX

## Overview

We need to plan out the animal rescue website before a single line of code can be written. So do the UX research—you’ll be graded on the completeness of your UX as Jed would expect.

Create 1 InVision board with the following pieces of information:

1. Target audience
2. Website goals
3. Competitive analysis
4. Sitemap (including the pages we’re not actually coding)
6. Visual design: type, colours, sample components (buttons, cards, etc.)
7. Wireframes: home page, inside page, application form page
  *These should be high-fidelity with some real text—paper is okay but use rulers*
  These are the pages we’ll eventually code
